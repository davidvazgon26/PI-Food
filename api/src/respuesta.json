Brown on all sides as much as possible on med-hi, adding broth when tofu starts to stick, loosening the tofu cubes and cooking until they start to stick again. When tofu cubes are browned well, add to onions and add rest of mushroom broth. If more liquid is needed, add water to cover stew if more liquid is needed.In same skillet, using water, use same process on carrots and mushrooms, browning and loosening with water and then add to the stew mixture.Finally, add crushed garlic, cover and simmer until full flavor has developed.This process of browning really increases the flavor of all the contents including the tofu.

The Granny Smith apples are diced quite small and then cooked in a reduction of honey, apple cider vinegar and spices. Granny Smiths are good to use because they won't break down into apple sauce during the cooking. The cooked apples are then used as a top crust and glaze for the roast pork. Some garlic roast potatoes and steamed veggies completed a wonderful family meal. Here's your Sunday supper!Lb pork loin or rib roast",
